  Bucan Befestigungstechnik AG was founded in 1998 by SÃ¼leyman Can Citir as a sole 
  proprietorship and has been a family business ever since. Focusing on an easy-to-use
  and innovative online expirience, we were able to re-create our  <a href="https://shop.bucan.ch">website</a> with state of
  the art technologies in 2021.
